Insertion Sort Complexity Analysis

Insertion Description 
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It iterates through the input array, comparing each element with its adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

Time Complexity:
** Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2)
Happens when the input array is in reverse order, for each element, we need to shift all the elements to the right. 
The algorithm performs appropriately n(n-1)/2 comparisions and swaps.

** Best-case time complexity: O(n)
Happens when the input array is already sorted.
The algorithm performs n-1 comparisons n-1 and no swap.

** Average-case time complexity: O(n^2)
Average case requires comparing and swapping approximately n(n-1)/4 elements. 
On Average cases, each element needs to compare with half of the sorted elements. 

** Space Complexity:
Space Complexity is O(1) as this algorithm uses a constant amount of extra memory for variables regardless of input size.
