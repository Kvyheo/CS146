Matrix Multiplication Time Complexity Analysis

Algorithm description 
The matrix multiplication algorithm takes two matrices, A and B, as input and producfes a new matrix, result. The algorithm uses nested loops to iterate through the elements of the matrices, computing the dot product for each element in the resulting matrix.

Time Complexity:
** Main Loop Complexity: O(rows_A * cols_B)
The outer loop iterates over the rows of matrix A, give the complexity of O(rows_A).
The middle loop iterates over the columns of matrix B, give the complexity of O(cols_B).
This main loop complexity is the product of the iterations of the outer and the middle loops: O(rows_A * cols_B).

** Inner Loop Complexity: O(cols_A)
This loop iterates over the columns of matrix A, give the complexity of O(cols_A).
This loop executed for each element of the resulting matrix.

** Algorithm Complexity: O(rows_A * cols_A * cols_B)
The overall time complexity is the product of the iterations of all three loops.

Space Complexity:
This space complexity is determined by the size of the resulting matrix result, which is of size rows_A * cols_B.
