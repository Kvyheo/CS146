# Homework 10 Solution Explaination

## Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

## Approach

The level order traversal of a binary tree is a breadth-first traversal technique. It visits all the nodes on the current level before moving to the next level. This approach is also known as Breadth-First Search (BFS) for trees.
The queue follows the FIFO principle which helps for processing nodes level by level. 
### Algorithm

1. Initialize an empty queue and an empty list that will contain the result.
2. If the root is not null, enqueue the root node.
3. While the queue is not empty:
    - Record the number of nodes at the current level (size of the queue).
    - For each node at this level:
        - Dequeue the node and add its value to the current level's list.
        - Enqueue the node's children (left child first, then right child).
    - Add the current level's list to the result list.
4. Return the result list.

### Edge Cases

- If the root is null, the binary tree is empty, and the function returns an empty list.
- The function correctly handles trees of different shapes and sizes, as long as the number of nodes does not exceed 2000 and node values are within the range of -1000 to 1000.
