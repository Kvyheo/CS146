# Course Scheduling Solution Explaination

## Problem Statement
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
For example, the pair [0,1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

## Problem Overview
The course scheduling problem asks whether it's possible to take all courses given a list of course prerequisites. This problem can be modeled as a graph, where each node represents a course, and edges represent prerequisite relationships. The core challenge is to detect if the graph contains a cycle, which would make it impossible to complete all courses.

## Solution Approach
The solution employs Depth-First Search (DFS) for cycle detection in a directed graph. Each node (course) can be in one of three states: unvisited, visiting, or visited. The algorithm traverses the graph using DFS, marking nodes as visiting when first encountered, and visited when all descendants are processed. If a node marked as visiting is encountered again, a cycle is detected, indicating it's impossible to complete all courses.

## Conclusion 
Detecting cycles in a directed graph through DFS is an effective way to solve the course scheduling problem.
