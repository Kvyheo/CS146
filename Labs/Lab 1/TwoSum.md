# TwoSum Problem
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input has exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

### Java Implementation:
1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Utilize nested loops to iterate through each pair of elements in the array.
   - Check if the sum of the current pair equals the target.
   - Return the indices if a match is found.
2. **Optimized Approach with HashMap:**
   - Use a HashMap to store the difference between the target and each element.
   - Iterate through the array and check if the complement exists in the map.
   - Return the indices if a complement is found.

### Python Implementation:
1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Implement nested loops to iterate through each pair of elements in the array.
   - Check if the sum of the current pair equals the target.
   - Return the indices if a match is found.
2. **Optimized Approach with Dictionary:**
   - Use a dictionary to store the difference between the target and each element.
   - Iterate through the array and check if the complement exists in the dictionary.
   - Return the indices if a complement is found.

## Testing 
Given the input array [2, 7, 11, 15] and target 9, the expected output is [0, 1] since nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9.

## Conclusion 
The code provides two different approaches to solving the TwoSum problem - a brute-force method and an optimized approach using HashMap (Java) or Dictionary (Python). The optimized solution reduces the time complexity for better efficiency.
